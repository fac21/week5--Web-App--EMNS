# week5--Web-App--EMNS

### This week we aimed to learn about databases, specifically a PostgreSQL database, as well as advancing our Node knowledge.

- Designing and documenting a database schema
- Create a relational database
- Read and write SQL queries
- Avoid SQL injection vulnerabilities
- Handle node errors
- Testing SQL and servers

# Project was not completed so the app is not completely functional.


We used all this database and node magically to create a page where users submit their park suggestions and comments!


### Our user stories

- As a visually impaired user I would like to be able to navigate through page
- As a user, I want to submit my own and other people's park suggestions with comment.
- As a user, I want to come back later to read our and other suggestions.
- Stretch goal: As a user, I want to search through the the suggestions by location.
